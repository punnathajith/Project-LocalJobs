// ðŸ§  Goal

// When a user posts a job, they must pay a holding amount.
// âž¡ The website/platform holds the funds (escrow) securely.
// âž¡ When the job is completed successfully, the amount is released to the worker (consumer user).
// âž¡ If the job fails or is cancelled, the amount is refunded to the job poster.
